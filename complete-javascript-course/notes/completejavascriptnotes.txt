Functions 

- Store the Return value of a function in a variable to use it anywhere! Give it a name then call the function! ex const x = func(parameter)! **IMPORTANT**
- Receive input data, transform data, then output data!
- array.indexOf() will return a number!
- array.includes() will return true or false!
 
 ---LOOPS--

 - Continue - if the condition is not true the code will hit continue and will not execute what is below the continue. It will go back to the next interation

 - Break - The break will immidiattly exit the whole loop when the condition is met. If (x === 'number') break; it wont execute nothing after this.
